## Homebrew Tap for Knative client `kn`

This repository contains the [Hombrew Tap](https://docs.brew.sh/Taps) for Knative clients.

To enable this Tap globally, use

```
brew tap knative/client
```

The supported clients are:

* [kn](https://github.com/knative/client) - The Knative CLI client


Install them with `brew install` like in

```
brew install kn
```

Alternatively you can also install the clients directly (without adding a tap globally) with

```
brew install knative/client/kn
```
